Universities continue to rapidly evolve to address the needs of diverse, growing student populations, while embracing advances in pedagogy and technology. With the revolution in big data, universities are striving to utilise their rich and complex digital data on learners towards the personalisation of education.

At The University of Queensland, we have developed an adaptive, student-facing learning platform
called RiPPLE (Recommendation in Personalised Peer Learning Environments) that provides
personalised content and learning support at scale. RiPPLE employs exemplary techniques from the fields of machine learning, crowdsourcing, learning analytics and recommender to provide the following main functionalities:

(1) Co-creation: RiPPLE empowers learners to contribute to co-creation of learning content.

(2) Knowledge tracing: RiPPLE approximates learnersâ€™ knowledge states based on their interactionswith the platform. It uses a variety of visualisations to enable learners to track their knowledge states and progress.

(3) Content recommendation: RiPPLE uses the knowledge state of learners to recommend formative exercises tailored to the needs of each individual.

(4) Peer Learning Support: RiPPLE recommends peer learning sessions based on the availability, learning preferences and needs of individuals. Students are given the opportunity to provide peer learning support, seek peer learning support or find study partners.

(5) Gamification: RiPPLE uses leaderboards and a badging system to increase student motivation and performance.

The RiPPLE platform has been released as an open-source package1 under the Apache 2.0 license and is freely available for usage in non-commercial settings. RiPPLE can be integrated into many popular learning management systems including Blackboard, Moodle and Canvas using the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard. It is designed to be scalable, allowing the system to be easily adopted by many courses across different faculties in many universities. It is also designed to be sustainable, requiring very low maintenance from the teaching team.
